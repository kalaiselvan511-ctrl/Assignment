JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language.

It is mainly used for developing dynamic and interactive web pages.

JavaScript can run in both the browser and the server (via Node.js).

It follows the ECMAScript specification standard.

JS is dynamically typed, meaning variables can change types at runtime.

Variables can be declared using var, let, and const.

let and const were introduced in ES6 to fix issues with var.

JavaScript supports multiple programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and procedural.

Functions are first-class citizens â€” they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, and returned.

JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance instead of classical inheritance.

The Document Object Model (DOM) can be manipulated using JS to update HTML and CSS dynamically.

Events like click, submit, and keydown can be handled using JavaScript.

Asynchronous programming is supported via callbacks, promises, and async/await.

JavaScript can interact with web APIs to fetch data from servers (using fetch() or XMLHttpRequest).

Closures allow inner functions to access outer function variables even after the outer function has finished executing.

The typeof operator helps identify the type of a variable.

Arrays and objects are reference types in JavaScript.

Hoisting moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope.

ES6 introduced modern features like arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, and spread operators.

Popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue are built using JavaScript
